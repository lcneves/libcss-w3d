LibCSS-w3d -- a CSS parser and selection engine for the w3d framework
===========================================

Overview
--------

  This is a fork of NetSurf's LibCSS that adds support to w3d properties.

  LibCSS is a CSS parser and selection engine. It aims to parse the forward
  compatible CSS grammar.

  The following properties have been added:

    + depth
    + max-depth
    + min-depth
    + far
    + near
    + margin-far
    + margin-near
    + padding-far
    + padding-near
    + overflow-z

  The following values have been added to the flex-direction property:

    + stack
    + stack-reverse

Requirements
------------

  LibCSS requires the following tools:

    + A C99 capable C compiler
    + GNU make or compatible
    + Pkg-config
    + Perl (for the testcases)
    + Python3 (minimum 3.6)

  LibCSS also requires the following libraries to be installed:

    +  LibParserUtils
    +  LibWapcaplet

Compilation
-----------

  If necessary, modify the toolchain settings in the Makefile.
  Invoke make:
  		$ make

Verification
------------

  To verify that the parser is working, it is necessary to specify a
  different makefile target than that used for normal compilation, thus:

  		$ make test

API documentation
-----------------

  Currently, there is none. However, the code is well commented and the
  public API may be found in the "include" directory. The testcase sources
  may also be of use in working out how to use it.
